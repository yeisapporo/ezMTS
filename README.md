# ezMTS
ezMTS(Easy Multitasking System) is a library for Arduino with ATMEGA 
Microcontrollers. This provides simple multitasking-like system to your 
Arduino. You can use multiple loop()-like functions on your Arduino 
sketch. This is not an operating system but an extension of an interrupt 
handler for Timer2. You should not use tone() in your sketch when using 
this library.
